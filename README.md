# [Doug](http://detectives.2016.angularattack.io/)

Doug is a tree of vector sprite components. He is made of three things. 

* __TS__ One Typescript file
* __CSS__ One CSS stylesheet
* __HTML__ An HTML5 template containing the vector path information

> When Angular2 animation is ready, we'll be adding that into the mix.

But Doug isn't alone in the world. Any noun can be a Doug.
